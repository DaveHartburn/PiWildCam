# PiWildCam

Early commit. A wildlife camera for the Raspberry Pi. It can sit as either a Pi and a camera module in a nextbox, or in a stand alone enclosure as a trailcam, with LCD screen for status and a PIR.

Full details and setup instructions pending.

First commit is something that just about works, but needs a lot of fiddling. Originally developed a number of years ago, so contains libraries and various ways of doing things that need a lot of improvement.
